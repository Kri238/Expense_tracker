 **Problem Statement**
To manage day-to-day expenses straightforwardly, without any hassle.People often struggle to keep track of their spending, leading to overspending without realizing it.  
To address this, I created a very basic **Expense Tracker** using Python. It allows users to store and retrieve their expenses in a clean, organized way using a CSV file.

 **Scope of the Project**
This project focuses on building a simple, command-line-based expense tracking tool.  
It includes the following:

- Adding expense details like date, category, amount, and description  
- Viewing all expenses at once  
- Filtering expenses by category  
- Searching for expenses by description  
- Using CSV files for data storage  
- Applying structured programming concepts such as modular design and top-down development  

This project does **not** include:
- Graphical interface  
- Database integration  
- Login features  
- Cloud-based syncing  


# Target Users
This project is intended for:

- Students who want a simple tool to monitor spending  
- Beginners learning Python, especially file handling  
- Anyone who prefers a lightweight and offline expense manager  
- Individuals doing academic programming projects
